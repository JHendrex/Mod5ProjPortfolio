# Module 5 Project: Portfolio

This is my submission for the project in module 5 which is meant to assess my understanding of bootstrap concepts and Javascript functions learned up to this point in the module. I chose to make a portfolio showcasing the biggest projects I made in Coding Temple since I did not have a favorite website to recreate.


## Features

- Three stylish and responsive webpage made using Bootstrap
- One functioning form with validation
- One table with table headers, striped rows, and hover effects
- A navigation bar with appropriate links
- Images appropriate for the pages and content
- Properly functioning buttons
- Javascript functions that properly work
## Javascript Functions

The following Javascript functions are included in this project:

- validateForm: Used to validate the form on the Contact page with appropriate error messages

- resetErrors: Used to empty all fields in the form on the Contact page when the reset button is pressed

- formSearch: Used to highlight search terms entered into the search bar inside the nav bar once the "Search" button is clicked

- getRandProject: Used to display a random project as a "featured" project for the Home page
